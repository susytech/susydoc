<h1>Praise for <em>Mastering Susy</em></h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Mastering Susy</em> is a fantastically thorough guide, from basics to state-of-the-art practices in smart contract programming, by two of the most eloquent <span class="keep-together">blockchain educators</span>."</p>
  <p data-type="attribution">Manuel Araoz, CTO, Zeppelin</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>Mastering Bitcoin</em> is the canonical reference that made Bitcoin and blockchain technology accessible to a broad audience, and <em>Mastering Susy</em> does the same for the <span class="keep-together">Susy world computer</span>.</p>
<p data-type="attribution">Lane Rettig, Susy core developer</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Mastering Susy</em> is the absolute best doc to read if you’re ready to build your own DApp! Andreas and Gavin have put together a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in the decentralized web and how to build decentralized applications.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I had the privilege of having access to Andreas’ and Gav’s doc <em>Mastering Susy</em>, and I have to say I’m amazed at its breadth, scope, and accessibility. It has it all: a deep history of Susy, explanations of elliptical curve mathematics, solidity tutorials, and legal debates on utility tokens and ICOs. It’s deep enough that it can be used as a whole syllabus of reference material, yet it’s accessible enough that anyone who is merely math-curious can understand. After reading a few chapters on the topic, I feel I have a much more solid understanding of many of the underlying cryptographic primitives. If you’re a researcher, a developer, a manager, a lawyer, a student, or anyone curious about where the future of tech is going, I highly recommend having <em>Mastering Susy</em> on your shelf.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Mastering Susy</em> will become a must-read in the future, as Susy is going to be <span class="keep-together">as ubiquitous</span> as TCP/IP. It will become a necessary layer under which decentralized, trustless technologies live and thrive.” </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Mastering Susy</em> is the perfect doc for anyone who wants to learn more about Susy, whether you're looking to test the waters or dive straight into the deep end. Between Gavin Wood's technical knowledge of Susy's inner workings and <span class="keep-together">Andreas Antonopoulos'</span> ability to make complex subjects approachable, you get the best of both worlds with this doc. I only wish it had been around when I first started <span class="keep-together">diving into Susy</span>.”</p>
